Such a test doesn't appear to have been reported in the publication.       \nAltman and Bland[@RN5623] discuss this issue of interaction and provide a simple method of calculation.  \n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ninter_action <- function(rr1, l1, u1, rr2, l2, u2){\n  log_rr1 <- log(rr1)\n  log_l1 <- log(l1)\n  log_u1 <- log(u1)\n  log_rr2 <- log(rr2)\n  log_l2 <- log(l2)\n  log_u2 <- log(u2)\n  se1 <- (log_u1-log_l1)/3.92\n  se2 <- (log_u2-log_l2)/3.92\n  diff_rr <- log_rr1 - log_rr2\n  diff_se <- sqrt(se1^2 + se2^2)\n  z <- abs(diff_rr) / diff_se\n  p <- 2*(1-pnorm(z))\n  ldiff <- diff_rr - 1.96*diff_se\n  udiff <- diff_rr +1.96*diff_se\n  RRR <- exp(diff_rr)\n  lCI_RRR <- exp(ldiff)\n  uCI_RRR <- exp(udiff)\n  ans <- paste0(\"The ratio of the relative risks is \", round(RRR,2), \", 95% CI \",\n               round(lCI_RRR,2), \" - \", round(uCI_RRR,2), \" p = \" , round(p,2))\n  list(ans)\n}\n\ninter_action(1.31,1.21,1.42,1.17,1.11,1.25)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[[1]]\n[1] \"The ratio of the relative risks is 1.12, 95% CI 1.01 - 1.24 p = 0.03\"\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe interaction test is indeed statistically positive but with the lower limit of the confience interval approaching 1, the statistical significance of this association is likely not terribly robust. For example, a very small amount of residual or unmeasured confounding could make the statistical significance vanish as shown in the following calculation. \n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(EValue)\nevalues.HR(1.12,1.01,1.24,rare = 0)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n         point lower upper\nRR        1.08  1.01  1.16\nE-values  1.38  1.09    NA\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\nAlso statistical significance and p values provide no information about the strength of the evidence as the same p value can arise from a large effect size in a moderate sample or a small effect size in a very large sample.   \n\n## A Bayesian approach\n\nRather than concentrating on directional hypothesis testing, i.e. drawing inferences based on the (in)compatability of the data with a null hypothesis  upon repeated sampling, a richer deeper understanding of the data can be obtained with quantitative hypothesis testing. This involves estimating the probabilities of women and men dying and then making direct comparisons with probability statements and represents a Bayesian approach to data analysis.    \n\nLet  y represent the observations and let the corresponding data generating mechanism be described by a distribution (likelihood) function $f(y|p)$, where *p* is a parameter of interest. In Bayesian statistics, the unknown parameter of interest *p* is not considered fixed but instead has a distribution. Before the experiment, the prior distribution *f(p)* is obtained from any previous knowledge about the parameter. The more knowledge is available, the more informative will this prior distribution be.\n\nThe object of Bayesian inference is the posterior distribution  *f(p|y)* after observing the data and is evaluated with Bayes’ theorem as follows:  \n$$f(p|y) = \\frac{f(y|p)f(p)}{\\int_{p}f(y|p)f(p)dp}$$\n\nThe response variable *y*, death in this case, has a binomial distribution with the total number of binomial trials, n, and the probability of the outcome, p:\n$$y \\sim Bin(n,p)$$\nIn the absence of any other information, a uniform or non-informative prior *Beta*(𝑎=1,𝑏=1) distribution is often assumed. When the prior is a *Beta* distribution and the data in the form of a binomial, the posterior distribution follows the same form as the prior, a *Beta* distribution, known as a congugate analysis which is expressed as  \n$$ p|y\\sim Beta(a+y,b+n-y)$$\n\nwith the posterior mean\n$$E(p|y) =\n\\frac{a+y}{a+y+b+n-y} = \\frac{a+y}{a+b+n} =\n\\frac{a+n\\bar{y}}{a+b+n}$$  \n\nIn this specific example, one can calaculate the probability of mortality for both men and women by combining the data from the publication (the likelihood) with our prior information (here assumed to be non-informative). Once the posterior probability functions for women and men become available, summary statistics and plots comparing them are easily obtained and interpreted.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# deaths for men and women\nd_w <- 1294           # women deaths\nn_w <- 2567           # women at risk\np_w <-d_w/n_w         # probability women dying\nsd_w <- sqrt(n_w*p_w*(1-p_w)) # sd women dying\nd_m <- 2376           # men deaths\nn_m <- 4859           #men at risk\np_m <- d_m/n_m       # probability men dying\nsd_m <- sqrt(n_m*p_m*(1-p_m))  # sd men dying\n\n# create a data frame of 10,000 men and 10,0000 women each with their respective probabilities \ndf <- data.frame(sex = factor(rep(c(\"F\", \"M\"), each=10000)),\n                   death_prop = c(rbinom(n=10000, size=n_w, prob=p_w)/n_w,\n                   rbinom(n=10000, size=n_m, prob=p_m)/n_m))\n\nq_f <- quantile(df[df$sex==\"F\",]$death_prop, c(.025,.5,0.975))\nq_m <- quantile(df[df$sex==\"M\",]$death_prop, c(.025,.5,0.975))\n\nggplot(df, aes(x = death_prop)) + \n   geom_density(aes(fill = sex), alpha = 0.4) +\n  labs(title = \"Mean probability of (wo)men with post-operative atrial fibrillation dying\", subtitle = \"Based on 10,000 simulations\", caption = \"Horizontal lines = 95% confidence intervals \\nDashed vertical lines = mean\") +\n  xlab(\"Mean probability dying\") +\n  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = mean(death_prop), color = sex), data = df[df$sex==\"F\",], linetype = \"dashed\") +\n  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = mean(death_prop), color = sex), data = df[df$sex==\"M\",], linetype = \"dashed\") +\n  theme_classic() +\n  geom_segment(aes(x=.485,xend=.523,y=0,yend=0), color=\"#F8766D\",linewidth = 2) +\n  geom_segment(aes(x=.475,xend=.503,y=1,yend=1), color=\"#00BFC4\", linewidth = 2)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.svg){fig-align='center' width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nTherefore mean probability of a woman dying is 0.504 with 95% CI 0.485 to 0.524.          \nWhile the mean probability of a man dying is 0.489 with 95% CI 0.475 to 0.503.    \n\n### What then is the probability that the mean mortality for women is greater than the mean mortality for men?\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmean_prob <- sum(df[df$sex==\"F\",]$death_prop > df[df$sex==\"M\",]$death_prop) / 10000\n```\n:::\n\n\n**The probability that the mean mortailty for women is greater than the mean probability for men is 0.892.**   \n\nThis analysis suggests that while the mean mortality for women is likely greater than for men, there remains a 1 in 10 chance that the reverse is true.   \n\n### What is the right research (clinical) question?\n\nMoreover, rather than comparing means what is arguably the more important research question is **whether the probability that the mortality for the next women with POAF will be greater than for the next man with POAF**.
