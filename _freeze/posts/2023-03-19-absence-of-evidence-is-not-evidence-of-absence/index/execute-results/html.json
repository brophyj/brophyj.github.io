Despite the fact that these publications have several thousand citations, this remains an important problem, even in high impact medical journals.     \n\nFor example, I recently read a [NEJM](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2204511) randomized clinical trial (RCT) investigating whether the addition of extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (eCPR) to standard conventional CPR (cCPR) can improve survival and diminish anoxic brain injury. Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest is a frequent event and its devastating\nconsequences are only partially mitigated by rapid commencement of basic life\nsupport with high-quality cCPR. There\nremains a substantial subset of individuals who do not respond rapidly\nto these measures and whether eCPR\ncan improve outcomes is an important clinical question.\nIn this trial, the primary outcome, 30 day survival without significant neurological\ndeficit, was an odds ratio of 1.4 (95% confidence interval, 0.5 to 3.5; P =\n0.52) in favor eCPR. This lead to the abstract\nconclusion \"In patients with refractory out-of-hospital cardiac arrest,\nextracorporeal CPR and conventional CPR had similar effects on survival\nwith a favorable neurological outcome\".    \n\nThis trial  addressed an important\nclinical question in the most challenging of research environments and the authors \nare to be congratulated on their trial design, its execution, and a\nnuanced discussion in the body of the article. However the constraints of standard statistical\nanalyses limits the quantitative appreciation of their data, and\nprevents a full and comprehensive data exploitation and updating of past\nknowledge. Trials that fail to meet\nstatistical significance and are often incorrectly thought of as\n\"negative\" trials, and the null hypothesis significance testing (NHST) paradigm favors this confusion\nbetween \"*absence of evidence and evidence of absence*\".     \n\nThe goal of this post is to demonstrate that a Bayesian\nperspective, by concentrating on posterior probabilities, permits additional insights into the specific clinical\nquestion and intrinsically avoids these misinterpretations.    \n\nThe post does not reiterate the many other reasons to be wary of\nnull hypothesis significance testing (NHST), p values and confidence\nintervals (see [here](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00031305.2019.1583913)). Rather it assumes the reader has perhaps heard that\nBayesian methods mirror our intuitive learning and diagnostic processes\nand is curious about its potential application to RCT analyses and\ninterpretations. Bayesian approaches provide benefits over standard\nstatistical analyses by avoiding dichotomizing results into statistical significance or not, with an\nobligatory loss of information and understanding. This is accomplished by concentrating on direct estimation of the parameters of interest and providing direct probability statements regarding their uncertainty (herein the\nrisk of survival with intact neurological status). The price to be paid for these benefits is the need to specify a prior distribution before seeing the current data.   \n\nThese probability statements arise from the posterior distribution\naccording to the Bayes Thereom, expressed as follows:\n$$ \\text{Posterior}  = \\frac{\\text{Probability of the data} * \\text{Prior}}{\\text{Normalizing Constant}} $$\n\nTherefore, in addition to the current data summarized by the probability\nof the data (likelihood function), prior probability distributions are\nrequired. Because our main focus is the analysis and interpretation of\nthe current RCT alone, an initial analysis may use a\ndefault vague parameter prior $$log(\\theta) \\sim Normal [0, 2.50]$$,\nthereby assuring that the posterior distribution is dominated by the\nobserved data.     \n\nPosterior distributions are summarized with medians and 95%\nhighest-density intervals (credible intervals (CrI)), defined as the\nnarrowest interval containing 95% of the probability density function. Bayesian analyses permit not only calculations of the\nposterior probability of any additional survival with eCPR (OR \\>1.00),\nbut also of clinically meaningful benefits. While there is no universal\ndefinition for a clinically meaningful benefit, a survival OR \\>1.10 may\nbe an acceptable threshold for many. Bayesian analyses also allows\ncalculation of the probability between any two points. For example,\nrather than simply comparing if the survival of one treatment is better\nthan another, one can calculate a range of practical equivalence (ROPE)\nbetween treatments. While different ranges may be proposed, +/- 10%\nseems a reasonable small difference that many would consider as\nequivalent.       \n\nThe graphical presentation of these results is shown below\n![](featured1.png)\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\nThis Bayesian analysis, using a default\nvague prior, produces an odds ratio (OR) 1.32 with 95% CrI 0.54 - 3.22) which aligns with the original analysis (OR, 1.4; 95% CI\n0.5 - 3.5) confirms the minimal impact of the default vague prior and\nreveals a Bayesian analysis completely dominated by the observed data. The eCPR probability density function for improved survival with eCPR\nis 73% with a 66% probability that this exceeds the clinically defined meaningful cutpoint of at least a 10% survival benefit. The probability of equivalence between the two techniques is 13%.    \n\nThe “take home” message from this Bayesian reanalysis is that standard statistical analyses resulting in a conclusion\nof “similar survival effects of eCPR to cCPR” may be overly simplified and potentially inaccurate. This\nBayesian analysis demonstrates that at present definitive conclusions regarding the superiority, inferiority,\nor equivalence of either approach are impossible. Rather the possibility of a clinically meaningful benefit,\nor less likely the possibility of clinically meaningful harm, has not been reasonably excluded and continued\nresearch is necessary to clarify the residual uncertainties. The final dilemma confronting clinicians is that\neven Bayesian analyses of randomized trials provide only probability estimates for average treatment effects\nand not for the more elusive individual treatment effect.\n\nOf course, an added benefit of the Bayesian analysis is its ability to incorporate previous knowledge.
