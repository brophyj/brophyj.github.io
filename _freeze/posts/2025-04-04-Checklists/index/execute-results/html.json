It is hard to conceive why the endothelium would react differently if it had experienced a previous revascularization procedure. More likely the observed protective role is due to collider risk stratification bias which has successfully explained the obesity, aspirin, and previous smoking paradoxes among many others[@RN6478][@RN7085][@RN7086]. This bias arises when study selection (in this case undergoing revascularization) is a collider, affected by both smoking and other (unmeasured) risk factors, creating a spurious association via an induced back door pathway. Study selection here was determined by the performance of revascularization which is not randomly assigned. Smokers are more likely to undergo initial revascularization and therefore non-smokers who receive revascularization tend to have substantially higher levels of other (unmeasured) risk factors, strong predictors for future revascularization. A simulation study assigning a smoking HR = 1.36 is reduced to 0.87 with 95% CI (0.82 to 0.92) when the general population is conditioned on the performance of an initial revascularization (the collider)[@RN7088]. This reversal is a classic example of collider bias, where conditioning on a collider variable, influenced by both the exposure and an unmeasured confounder distorts the true effect.\n\n## Background on collider risk stratification\n\nConsider a simplified data generating mechanism (DGM) for the development of coronary artery disease, reequiring revascularizaion, in the general population. Let's assume that causal factors are smoking and all other risk factors are combined into one other variable. The causal diagram is therefore as follows\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(ggdag)\n\nrevasc_dag <- collider_triangle(\n  x = \"Smoking\",\n  y = \"Other (unmeasured) risk factors\",\n  m = \"Revascularization\"\n)\n\nggdag(revasc_dag, text = FALSE, use_labels = \"label\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nHere for the general population we have assumed that smoking and the other risk factors are independent (no connecting arrow). But look what happens if we select (stratify or condition) on receiving a revascularization procedure.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nimg <- ggdag_dseparated(revasc_dag,\n                 controlling_for = \"m\",\n                 text = FALSE, use_labels = \"label\"\n)\nimg\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggsave(\"images/collider/preview-image.jpg\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nSaving 7 x 5 in image\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nThis has induced a relationship between smoking and the other risk factors. If the patient is a non-smoker then they must have other risk factors since they required a revascularization procedure. This means that in general that amount the sampe population of those have received an initial revascularization procedure, the non-smokers ill be sicker than the smokers. Alternatively the smokers will look to be protected by their smoking even though the underlying data generating mechaism (with an increased risk due to smoking) has not been altered. \\\nCollider-stratification bias is responsible for many cases of bias, including selection bias, missing data, and publication bias.\n\n## Simulated data\n\nTo concretely demonstrate this spurious association we will perform a numerical simulation. Assume 10,000 individuals with a 30% smoking prevalence and a normal disribution of the other (unmeasured) risk factors, (U). The probability of receiving a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is modeled using a logistic model where both smoking and U increase the chance of PCI.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Set a seed for reproducibility\noptions(digits = 2)\n# ---------------------------\n# Chunk 1: Generate Full Population Data\n# ---------------------------\nset.seed(123)\n\n# Population parameters for outcome data generating model (DGM):\nn <- 100000               # Total individuals\np_smoking <- 0.3          # Smoking prevalence\nbeta_smoking <- 0.3       # True effect of smoking (log-odds); OR ≈ exp(0.3) ≈ 1.35\nbeta_U <- 1               # Effect of U on outcome\nintercept_outcome <- -2   # Outcome intercept for repeat PCI\n\n# Simulate predictors:\nsmoking <- rbinom(n, 1, p_smoking)\nU <- rnorm(n)             # Unobserved risk factor\n\n# Generate outcome (repeat PCI) for full population using the same DGM:\nlogit_outcome <- intercept_outcome + beta_smoking * smoking + beta_U * U\np_outcome <- exp(logit_outcome) / (1 + exp(logit_outcome))\nrepeat_PCI <- rbinom(n, 1, p_outcome)\n\n# ---------------------------\n# Chunk 2: Generate PCI via a Deterministic (Threshold) Rule\n# ---------------------------\n# Define PCI as follows:\n#   For smokers (smoking == 1): PCI = 1 if U > 0.5.\n#   For non-smokers (smoking == 0): PCI = 1 if U > 1.5.\nPCI <- ifelse(smoking == 1, as.numeric(U > 0.5), as.numeric(U > 1.1))\n\n# Combine into one data frame:\ndf <- data.frame(smoking, U, PCI, repeat_PCI)\n\n# ---------------------------\n# Chunk 3: Full Population Analysis\n# ---------------------------\n# Fit a logistic regression for repeat PCI on smoking (ignoring U) in the full population:\nmodel_full <- glm(repeat_PCI ~ smoking, data = df, family = binomial)\ntemp <- summary(model_full)\nsummary(model_full)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n\nCall:\nglm(formula = repeat_PCI ~ smoking, family = binomial, data = df)\n\nCoefficients:\n            Estimate Std.

In the real world this world, a probabilistic mnodel would be employed\\\n \\\nNow let's see the effect of smoking on the study population, i.e. only those that underwent an initial revascularization procedure. Here we assume the same DGM for a future repeat PCI as initially applied to the general population i.e. smoking risk = 1.3\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# ---------------------------\n# Chunk 4: Analysis in PCI-Selected Sample\n# ---------------------------\n# Restrict the data to individuals with PCI == 1:\ndata_PCI <- subset(df, PCI == 1)\n\n# Fit the logistic regression model for repeat PCI on smoking in the PCI-selected sample:\nmodel_PCI <- glm(repeat_PCI ~ smoking, data = data_PCI, family = binomial)\ntemp1 <- summary(model_PCI)\nsummary(model_PCI)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n\nCall:\nglm(formula = repeat_PCI ~ smoking, family = binomial, data = data_PCI)\n\nCoefficients:\n            Estimate Std.

Hence the false impression that smoking is protective.\\      \n\n\n## References\n",
