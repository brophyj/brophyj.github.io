Here are some of the more common\nprobability distributions and their utility according to the available\ndata.\n\n![](images/slide1.png){width=\"75%\" fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n### Normal distribution\n\nNormal distributions are ubiquitous and generally reasonably well\nunderstood. They are important in medicine, at least partly due to the\ncentral limit theorem that states under some conditions, the average of\nmany samples (observations) of a random variable with finite mean and\nvariance is itself a random variable—whose distribution converges to a\nnormal distribution as the number of samples increases. Therefore,\nphysical quantities that are expected to be the sum of many independent\nprocesses, such as measurement errors, often have distributions that are\nnearly normal.\\\n<br> Mathematically the normal distribution is expressed as\n$$f(x) =  \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2 \\pi \\sigma^2}} e^{-\\frac{(x-\\mu)^2}{2 \\sigma^2}}$$\n\nwhere\\\n${\\mu}$ is the mean or expectation of the distribution (and also its\nmedian and mode)\n\n${\\sigma^{2}}$ is the variance and\n\n${\\sigma }$ is the standard deviation of the distribution\n\nGraphically this may be plotted as shown\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nn_dis = tibble(dist = c(dist_normal(0, 1)))\n\nn_dis %>%\n  ggplot(aes(y = format(dist), xdist = dist)) +\n  stat_halfeye(aes(fill = after_stat(abs(x) < 1.96))) +\n  labs(ggtitle=\"Normal (0,1) distribution\", subtitle=\"Blue = 95% area\", caption = \"thick horizontal black line represents +/- 1 sd (68%) \\nthin horizontal black line represents +/- 2 sd (95%)\") +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"gray85\", \"skyblue\")) + \n  scale_y_discrete(expand = c(0, 0, 0, 1)) +\n  ylab(\"\") +\n  theme_bw() +\n  theme(legend.position=\"none\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png){fig-align='center' width=50%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Student's t distribution\n\nThe Student's t distribution is another continuous probability\ndistribution that generalizes the standard normal distribution,\nremaining symmetric around zero and bell-shaped but with heavier tails.\nThe amount of probability mass in the tails is controlled by the\nparameter ${\\nu}$. For ${\\nu = 1}$ the Student's t distribution becomes\nthe standard Cauchy distribution, which has very \"fat\" tails; whereas\nfor ${\\nu = \\infty}$ it becomes the standard normal distribution\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nn_t_dis = tibble(\n  dist = c(dist_normal(0, 1), dist_student_t(3, 0, 1))\n)\n\nn_t_dis %>%\n  ggplot(aes(y = format(dist), xdist = dist)) +\n  stat_halfeye(aes(fill = after_stat(abs(x) < 1.96))) +\n  labs(title=\"Normal and t distribution\", subtitle = \"t distribution with 3 degrees of freedon\", caption = \"thick horizontal black line represents +/- 1 sd (68%) \\nthin horizontal black line represents +/- 2 sd (95%)\") +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"gray85\", \"skyblue\")) + \n  xlim(-5,5) +\n  scale_y_discrete(expand = c(0, 0, 0, 1)) +\n  ylab(\"\") +\n  theme_bw() +\n  theme(legend.position=\"none\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png){fig-align='center' width=75%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Uniform distribution\n\nThe uniform distribution assumes that all continuous outcomes between\nboundaries have an equal probability of occurring.\\\nGraphically,\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Create a density plot using ggplot2\nggplot(data.frame(Values = runif(10000, min = 0, max = 1)), aes(x = Values)) +\n  geom_density(fill = \"blue\", alpha = 0.5) +  \n  labs(title = \"Density Plot of Uniform Distribution (0,1)\", x = \"Values\", y = \"Density\") +\n  theme_minimal()  \n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png){fig-align='center' width=50%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Binomial Distribution\n\nHowever for this quiz, the data are not continuous but discrete with\ncounts and therefore the above distributions would be inappropriate\nmodels (cf negative counts being impossible). A binomial distribution is\na discrete probability distribution that describes the number of\nsuccesses in a fixed number of **independent Bernoulli trials, where\neach trial has the same probability of success, denoted by *p***. The\ndistribution is characterized by two parameters: *n* the number of\ntrials, and *p*, the probability of success in each trial.\n\nMathematically, this can be expressed as\\\n$$P(X = k) = {n \\choose x} * p^k * (1 - p)^{n-k}$$ • *P(X=k)* is the\nprobability of having k successes in n trials\n\n• (nCk) is the binomial coefficient, also known as \"n choose k\", which\nrepresents the number of ways to choose k successes from n trials\n\n• *p* is the probability of success in each trial\n\n• *1-p* is the probability of failure in each trial\n\n• *n* is the total number of trials\n\n• *k* is the number of successes\n\nBinomial distributions are commonly used to model situations such as\ncoin flips, where there are two possible outcomes (success or failure)\nand each trial is independent of the others. They have obviously\napplications in various fields, including medicine.\n\n### Poisson Distribution\n\nThe Poisson distribution is a discrete probability distribution that\nrepresents the number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time or\nspace, given that these events occur with a constant rate and\nindependently of the time since the last event. It is named after the\nFrench mathematician Siméon Denis Poisson.\n\nMathematically this can be expressed as\\\n\n$$P(X = k) = \\frac{\\lambda^k * e^{-\\lambda}}{k!}$$ • *P(X=k)* is the\nprobability of observing k events in a given period of time\n\n• $\\lambda$ is the **expectation** of the events over the same period of\ntime\n\nFor a Poisson random variable, the **variance = mean = E(Y) =**\n\\$\\lambda <br> The Poisson distribution is a special case of the\nbinomial, with trials *n* -\\> $\\infty$ and *p* (any trial success) -\\>\n0\\\nIf *p* is small, binomial P(*k* successes) $\\approx$ poisson P(*k* with\n$\\lambda$ = *np*)\\\nThe Poisson distribution is perhaps better appreciated by plotting the\nabove equation\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Build Poisson distributions\noptions(digits = 3)\np_dat <- map_df(1:4, ~ tibble(\n  l = paste(.),\n  x = 0:10,\n  y = dpois(0:10, .)\n))\n# Use ggplot2 to plot\nggplot(p_dat, aes(x, y, color = factor(l, levels = 1:5))) +\n  geom_line() +\n  geom_point(data = p_dat, aes(x, y, color = factor(l, levels = 1:5))) +\n  labs(color = \"Lambda:\") +\n  ggtitle(\"Poisson distribution for varying rates (Lambda)\") +\n  scale_x_continuous(\"no. of events\",breaks=seq(0,10, 1)) +\n  ylab(\"probability\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){fig-align='center' width=60%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Quiz Results\n\nI received replies from 15 (42%, n= 36) MUHC cardiology staff and 4\n(18%, n = 22) fellows with the following results\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndat1 <- read.csv(\"results1.csv\", header = T) |> \n  pivot_longer(cols=c('q1', 'q2'),\n               names_to='question',\n               values_to='value') |> \n  mutate(id=factor(id))\n\npd <- position_dodge(0.2)\ndat1 %>% \n  mutate(value = fct_relevel(value, \n                            \"<1%\", \"1-4.9%\", \"5-9.9%\", \n                            \"10-14.9%\", \">15%\")) |> \n  ggplot(aes(x = question, y = value, group = id, color=id)) +\n  geom_point(position = pd) +\n  geom_line(position = pd, linewidth = 1/3, alpha = 1/2) +\n  guides(color = \"none\") +\n  facet_wrap(~ q4, labeller = label_both, axes = \"all_y\") +\n  xlab(\"Questions 1 & 2\") +\n  ylab(\"Prabability intervals\") +\n  ggtitle(\"Responses for Questions 1 & 2\") +\n  theme_ggdist()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png){fig-align='center' width=60%}\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndat2 <- read.csv(\"results1.csv\", header = T) |> \n  mutate(id=factor(id), q3 = factor(q3))\ndat2 %>% \n  mutate(value = fct_relevel(q3, \n                            \"< 25%\", \"25-50%\", \"51-75%\", \n                            \"76-95%\")) |> \n  ggplot(aes(x = q3, group = id, color=id)) +\n  geom_bar(stat=\"count\", width=0.7, fill=\"lightblue\")+\n  guides(color = FALSE) +\n  facet_wrap(~ q4, labeller = label_both, axes = \"all_y\") +\n  xlab(\"Questions 3\") +\n  ylab(\"Counts\") +\n  labs(title = \"Responses for Questions 3\", subtitle = \"Probability MVIV is as safe or safer than standard redo OR\") +\n  theme_ggdist()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nWarning: The `<scale>` argument of `guides()` cannot be `FALSE`.

Of the 16 respondents who incorrectly\nestimated the probability, most (13 of 16) underestimated the\nprobability of observing 0 deaths.\\\n<br> For Q2, most respondents (13/19, 68%) correctly reasoned that if\nthe true underlying mortality increased, it would be more unlikely to\nobserve 0 deaths. However 6 individuals didn't appreciate this and\nincorrectly predicted no change or an increase in the probability of\nobserving 0 deaths if the true underlying rate was higher.\\\n<br> For Q3, there are many assumptions required and estimates are\nlikely fairly unreliable. Nevertheless, the question asked to ignore the\npotential biases and to consider only the data in this one study. Only 2\n(10.5%) of individuals correctly estimated the probability of MVIV being\nas safe or safer than a redo being in the 76-95% interval. 12 of 19\n(63%) of respondents estimated this probability at being under 50%.\\\n<br>\\\nDrawing meaningful conclusions is obviously limited by the limited\nnumber of respondents, especially among the fellows. It is unknown if\nrespondents have better, worse or same quantitative skills as the\nnon-respondents. Notwithstanding this limitation, it would appear from\nthe wide range of responses and the limited number of \"correct\" answers\nthat additional quantitative training may be helpful.\n\n## References\n",
