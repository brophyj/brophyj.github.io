control glucose\"\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n            Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value   Pr(>F)\ngroup        3   1953     651      10 0.000046\nResiduals   40   2594      65                 \n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](images/RplotFig1.png){width=875}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nFinding these large differences even before any of the interventions could take effect should be a red flag for reservations about the final conclusions.\\\n[The outcome measure]{style=\"color: red;\"}\\\nUsing the outcome measure as the difference in glucose levels between the active treatments strategies and the control (baseline) group is a potentially fatal flaw.\nThe fatal flaw is using the difference from baseline as their outcome measure.\n[Bland and Altman](https://trialsjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1745-6215-12-264) have published about why this \"is biased and invalid, producing conclusions which are, potentially, highly misleading. The actual alpha level of this procedure can be as high as 0.50 for two groups and 0.75 for three\".\nIn short, we need to remember what is being randomized, it is the assignment to a given treatment strategy.\nIndividuals are not randomized to their baseline glucose levels, any more than they are randomized to their weights, heights, eye color, or any other characteristic.\nWith small sample sizes we may well expect that even in randomized samples, there may be meaningful differences in these characteristics, therefore including them as a component of the outcome is not appropriate and may bias the results.\\\n[Harrell](https://www.fharrell.com/post/errmed/) lists all the many assumptions required to be met before analyzing change from baseline could (potentially) be used.\\\ni.\nthe variable is not used as an inclusion/exclusion criterion for the study, otherwise regression to the mean will be strong\\\nii.\nif the variable is used to select patients for the study, a second post-enrollment baseline is measured and this baseline is the one used for all subsequent analysis\\\niii.\nthe post value must be linearly related to the pre value\\\niv.\nthe variable must be perfectly transformed so that subtraction “works” and the result is not baseline-dependent\\\nv. the variable must not have floor and ceiling effects\\\nvi.\nthe variable must have a smooth distribution\\\nvii.\nthe slope of the pre value vs. the follow-up measurement must be close to 1.0 when both variables are properly transformed (using the same transformation on both)\n\nWith this in mind, this study doesn't meet these assumptions (according to their CONSORT Fig 1, glucose was an entrance criteria, therefore possible regression to the mean may be present, glucose has a definite “floor effect”, and no proof that model is linear).\n\nTo demonstrate the bias inherent in using change from baseline as opposed to final glucose reading alone, let’s again use the simulated data.\nWe will analyze (ANOVA) and plot the outcome according to treatment where the outcome is i) the final glucose reading in each group or ii) ii) the change from baseline for each group.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](images/RplotFig2.png){width=875}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThis suggests the original analysis is quite wrong and there is likely no difference between the strategies being tested.\nThis is no surprise as with only 11 (or 9) subjects), even with a crossover design, the differences would have to be to very large to reach statistical significance.\nSee the common sense response to the opening question above.\n\nThere are some other additional discussion points to consider.\\\n1.\nWhile 18 subjects were randomized only 11 were analyzed and 2 of them had missing values.\nThis raises the possibility of a non-quantifiable selection bias.\\\n2.\nThe authors report a post-hoc power calculation, a statistically inappropriate and nonsensical technique.\nIf a nonsignificant finding was obtained, power will always be low to detect the observed effect size, as observed power is directly related to the obtained P value, with the former providing no additional information than the latter.\\\n3.\nThere is no discussion of whether these measured outcomes have any clinical relevance.\nSuppose against all reason, the true glucose incremental area under the curve differential for the best treatment strategy was indeed the reported -11.8 mg% over 8 hours.\nThis translated to 1.4 mg% / hour for an 8 hour day or 0.47 mg% / hour over 24 hours.\nHow likely would this small (i.e. trivial) a difference have any meaningful clinical effect?\nImportant to recall the adage\\\n<br>\\\n[**“Measure what is important and don’t make important what you can measure”**]{style=\"color: red;\"}\n",
