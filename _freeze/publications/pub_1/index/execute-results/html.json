The short- and long-term variability of hs-cTnT in stable patients with or without coronary artery disease (CAD) is unknown. Methods; Prospective cohort study of 75 stable patients with CAD and 3 differing clinical profiles (stable angina [SA]; remote myocardial infarction [MI]; repetitive acute coronary syndrome [ACS]) and 25 controls without angiographic CAD, each with 15 hs-cTnT measurements over 1 year. Results; Individual results (1491 measurements) did not vary over within-day, daily, weekly, monthly, seasonal, or yearly time windows.The overall median was 2.8 ng/L (interquartile range [IQR] 5.2 ng/L) with the highest median (6.3 ng/L) and variability (IQR 6. 9 ng/L) in the repetitive ACS group. Diabetes, impaired renal function, and raised C-reactive protein were independent predictors of higher hs-cTnT values (average increase by 8.5 ng/L [95% CI, 5.0-11.9], 5.0 ng/L [95% CI, 2.0-8.1] and 4.0 ng/L (95% CI, 1.0-7.0), respectively). The 99th percentile value of all hs-cTnT measurements in the combined stable patients with CAD was 39 ng/L compared with 14 ng/L in the non-CAD patients.   Conclusions; Individual hs-cTnT readings in both patients with and without CAD were stable over hours, days, weeks, and months. Diabetes, poor renal function, and elevated C-reactive protein were independent predictors of higher median and IQR hs-cTnT values, often exceeding conventional thresholds. These findings highlight the need for caution and clinical contextualization in the interpretation of hscTnT results.    \nFull publication, supplementary notes, and statistical code can be found [here](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cjca.2019.08.022)\n",
