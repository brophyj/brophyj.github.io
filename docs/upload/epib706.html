<p>This is a discussion-based course and, quite frankly, it simply won’t work well without engagement and participation from all of us (including me). Of course, everyone has their own level of comfort speaking up, as well as varying levels of interest in some of these topics, so we (since I largely share the viewpoints of Sam Harper who has structured the course and given it for the last several years, but is presently on sabbatical, first-person plural pronouns are used) have no expectation that everyone participates equally. What we do ask is that you make a sincere effort to engage with the material, both in terms of the reading and in different forums for discussion. Learning how to respectfully express your opinion about conceptual and methodological issues, and to respectfully listen, engage, and respond to the opinions of others is a core part of being a scientist.</p>

<p>The assigned readings are the core of the course material, and students are expected to carefully and critically read each assignment <em>before</em> class. To facilitate student engagement with the reading we will use the online tool <a href="http://perusall.com">Perusall</a> for all required readings. Perusall is a reading platform in which students (and faculty) annotate texts collaboratively alongside one another. More information on how Perusall works and how it is integrated into the course is available <a href="https://asuonline.wistia.com/medias/dvaftxxad7">here</a> (thank you Arizona State!). To access Perusall through MyCourses, navigate to Content &gt; Readings &gt; Perusall, and then click the “Open Link” button. This will take you to the Perusall site and automatically register you as a member of the course. If you are having any trouble accessing the readings through Perusall contact me right away. I will not be using Perusall’s grading features, but I expect you to read, post questions, respond to other students questions and answers, and to take an active role in generating productive discussion.</p>

<h2 data-number="4.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="writing"><span class="header-section-number">4.2</span> Writing</h2>
<p>The discussions in the course are meant to activate your critical thinking skills, and to encourage you to synthesize your own thoughts on the material, these insights should be transferable to your area of research interest. Toward that end, over the course of the semester you will be asked to submit <strong>one</strong> original, critical essay that explores a topic of relevance to epidemiologic science. It may be a direct response to material that we read or discuss in class, or it may be an essay exploring other topics relevant to your work that demonstrate a good-faith effort to engage with the class material. These should take the form of a commentary similar (in spirit) to those we have read during the semester, and should be no longer than 1500 words. This represents approximately 5 pages of double spaced material. While this may seem unnecessarily constrained, it also has a latent objective of encouraging precise synthesis and focused writing for the essay, emphasizing the key arguments you want to make. An outline of the essay is due on <span style="color: red"><strong>March 10, 2025</strong></span> and the final essay is due on <span style="color: red"><strong>April 10, 2025</strong></span>. I will provide examples of what I think are good pieces of writing to aspire to.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="leading-discussion">Leading Discussion</h3>
<p>In addition to the writing assignment, each student will be asked to lead <strong>at least one</strong> day of discussion among the topics that we will cover (and probably more than one for most of you). For that session, you will come prepared to <em>briefly</em> summarize the material we have read, and to prepare some discussion points to help keep the conversation moving. I have created a Google spreadsheet with the current days for each topic <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1njZXu5oLeYKnTOYkb6NZVS90Lgk4aQ6C5yXGdqOTCi0/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>. Please sign-up for a session and we can have a discussion about the readings and where to draw on other resources for the topic. Note: We have 25 sessions and 15 students this year, so not everyone is required to lead 2 sessions. You should be able to sort this out, but if the remaining slots don’t get filled I will happily assign them.</p>
<p>Although each class session is 1.5 hours, there will inevitably be topics that come up that we can’t fully address in class. I encourage you to use the <a href="https://mycourses2.mcgill.ca/d2l/le/770484/discussions/List">Discussion</a> section of MyCourses to post questions or comments there. I may also post any additional pertinent links to additional readings for those interested.</p>

<section id="participation" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="participation">Participation</h3>
<p>Real engagement means <em>active</em> participation. This can take many forms, but for some general guidance, this means:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Showing up for each class <em>having read and engaged with the material assigned</em>. It will help facilitate discussion if you could aim to contribute at least 2-3 points for discussion or questions about the material in Perusall, and bring those to class;</p></li>
<li><p>Focusing during class discussion and avoiding distractions, and being present and intellectually engaged during the discussion;</p></li>
<li><p>Asking questions about anything in the readings that seems unclear or objectionable (in class, outside class, online). This can include both specific ideas from the readings, as well as synthesizing or finding themes common to different readings or our discussion;</p></li>
<li><p>Offering respectful arguments and responses, and respectfully listening to the arguments and responses of others. Contributions should be relevant and helpful and demonstrate that you are engaging with the material being discussed at the time, and that you are well-prepared for class.</p></li>

<p>Why are we doing this?</p>
<p>Because this is not a didactic course that is focused on learning methods or technical skills, and because in the past this course has often been critiqued for not providing a solid rationale for why it even exists, I owe it to you to provide some justification for the topics and readings I’ve chosen, as well as for why I think this material would be useful for your doctoral training. For each set of assigned material (the ‘What’), I’ve included a brief rationale (the ‘Why’). I hope you find it helpful.</p>

<p>In the first session we will talk generally about high-level questions regarding the discipline of epidemiology as a whole. Although you are early on in your training, I think it is valuable for you to be aware of these broader discussions about where the field stands in relation to its past, and what the appropriate balance should be between descriptive, causal, or implementation questions. Having some knowledge about the intellectual history of different concepts (“risk factor epidemiology”, “consequential epidemiology”) will help you to figure out where your own work stands in relation to the discipline as a whole.</p>

<p>The Davey Smith paper provides a bit of historical orientation to the ‘modern’ epidemiology training you are getting, as well as a critique of it in relation to epidemiology’s past. I chose the Lesko et al.&nbsp;paper because it focuses on the relationship between the tools of epidemiology (about which you are learning a lot in this first year) and the kinds of questions that can be answered with those tools. In particular, they focus on differences between purely descriptive questions, questions about synthesized evidence on causal relationships, and questions about specific interventions for which we want to estimate a causal effect. I also like that it was written by early career researchers whose training is in many ways similar to your own.</p>

<p>Asking good questions is central to advancing epidemiologic knowledge, but what makes a question ‘good’? Is ‘novelty’ more important than making incremental progress? Should it matter whether a given question will produce ‘actionable’ evidence? And is it problematic if a study’s methods are not well aligned with the question it seeks to answer? Is it wasteful (or, even unethical) to produce such work?</p>

Fox et al.&nbsp;argue for the importance and need to reinvigorate descriptive epidemiology, and make a case that this has particular consequences for both theory and methods. The paper by Hernan and colleagues tries to lay out how questions and methods should be aligned in empirical data science research. This paper was written when enthusiasm for machine learning and other empirical data science algorithms began achieving a high degree of influence, and their paper aims to try and clarify the utility of being clear about the question being asked, the methods used to answer it, and the role of expert knowledge in generating the result.</p>

<p>Much of modern epidemiologic training now starts with the introduction of potential outcomes framework, as well as introducing DAGs as a way to draw and consider assumptions needed for doing causal inference. What are the implications of using these frameworks for the kinds of questions that can be asked and answered in epidemiology? Do we risk restricting ourselves to ‘formal’ methods when it comes to causal questions, or are other alternatives possible? These are fundamental questions about the nature of epidemiologic inquiry, and it is useful for you to consider the benefits and drawbacks that may come with adopting this epistemological stance. As you progress in your training, you’ll need to decide on how you will approach questions of causal inference both in your own work and in your evaluations of the wider epidemiologic literature.</p>

<p>The second set of readings for this week is meant to engage with a more specific critique of ‘modern’ causal inference methods, namely, the notion that ‘good’ causal questions are based on well-defined interventions. This is a more recent argument, largely associated with Miguel Hernan and linked to the idea of using ‘target trials’ to formulate questions for observational studies.</p>
<p>As academics are wont to do, there has been some pushback against this idea, notably by Sharon Schwartz, another long-term and thoughtful critic of epidemiology (see her nice 1999 pre-causal-inference-revolution paper in Am J Public Health on the consequences of what she called, ‘Type III error’ which is about asking the wrong question). She and other critics are pushing back against this idea and trying to understand it’s implications (again) for the kinds of <em>causal</em> questions we can answer (and note that I think this is a different sort of critique than was being made by Krieger/Davey Smith).</p>

<p>Longstanding debates about whether exposures that are not directly (or perhaps even theoretically) manipulable, such as race, ethnicity, sex, or country-of-birth, present important challenges for the counterfactual models of causal inference you have been learning about. This set of readings aims to try and clarify some of these conceptual questions and derive potential paths forward that respect the “rules” of causal inference but that can also provide evidence that may be useful for reducing differences in health across non-manipulable factors.</p>

Meanwhile, Glymour and Spiegelman offer more of a defense of the idea that non-manipulable factors are causes and deserve the same kind of consideration and treatment as other exposures we study routinely in epidemiology. Finally, the blog post by Boyd is a relatively new piece making strong arguments for how race should be reported and interpreted in epidemiologic and clinical studies.</p>

<p>Taking a bit of a break from conceptual readings on questions and causal inference, in the second session we delve into a case study of the challenges in the use of race in clinical medicine. Should we use race as a factor in recommending treatments to patients? Does it matter whether or not race is a cause of the outcome, or whether including race might affect inequalities? The two papers from Vyas et al.&nbsp;and Manski arrive at different arguments regarding whether or not race should be included, and I think they provide a rich set of issues to discuss that complement the arguments about how we should study non-manipulable exposures in epidemiology.</p>

As epidemiologists, I think you will benefit from getting into the weeds a bit about randomized designs and grappling with questions about when and where they might be appropriate.</p>

<p>Despite some important strengths of randomized designs, especially for exchangeability, in some cases it just won’t be feasible or ethical to pursue a randomized design. What then? Anything goes? Just plug all the confounders into your regression and hope for the best? There are still good reasons to consider thinking conceptually about the trial you would design if feasibility and ethical issues were irrelevant, and then attempting to pursue an observational design that corresponds as closely as possible to your hypothetical “target trial”.</p>
<p>Lodi et al.&nbsp;are really focused on comparing results from an observational study to a trial that both investigate the same question, and their paper shows a practical example of how you might think about approaching this question (I would say even if you don’t have trial data). Nevertheless, this design still focuses almost entirely on regression adjustment as a way of achieving exchangeability–a rather strong assumption, and one that may be difficult to sell to critics.</p>
<p>Finally, Barninghausen et al.&nbsp;provide an overview of benefits and drawbacks of quasi-experimental strategies that, by design, control for at least some sources of unmeasured confounding. These designs are becoming more common in epidemiology and are worth considering when deciding on how you might approach a causal question when randomization is not feasible.</p>

<p>Okay, so now suppose that we’ve decided on a question and a (randomized or non-randomized) design. Who should be in our sample? It is important that we obtain a random sample of our target population, or can we use a convenience sample? And how does this change depending on the goal of our study, i.e., to estimate a prevalence <em>versus</em> develop a prediction model <em>versus</em> estimate a causal effect?</p>

<p>Debates about whether studies designed to estimate causal effects need to be representative, or alternatively should purposefully be designed not to be representative, have been persistent in epidemiology, but have also become more pressing given increasing concerns for generalizability. This paper by Rothman arguing that causal studies should avoid representative samples created a bit of a stir a few years ago, and has produced some additional empirical work on how much this matters. These issues are important for when you are both producing and consuming research, and it will be worthwhile to struggle a bit with them. I’ve also included a recent empirical piece that attempts to assess the quantitative consequences for a specific set of exposures and outcomes.</p>

<p>This question probably won’t go away over the course of your PhD training, or in the near future, so it is important to grapple with it. What are the consequences of the way we currently teach and use p-values (or 95% confidence intervals), how does it affect the way you read and interpret evidence? Should we banish the term “statistically significant” and, if so, why? How will you argue against peer reviewers and journal editors (or even your supervisors) that demand you include p-values (or, even worse, stars for levels of ‘significance’) in your revisions? This is a core issue of moving from sampled data and analysis to the kind of inferences you will make about causal effects. How will you approach it?</p>

<p>Given the Wasserstein paper’s suggestion to abandon statistical significance, questions naturally arise about how we should do inference instead of using p-values. Most epidemiologists are trained to use confidence intervals rather than p-values, but it does not appear to have changed the basic problem of scientists dichotomizing evidence using arbitrary statistical rules. These papers attempt to provide some alternative avenues to explore. Greenland et al.&nbsp;continue their quest to promote notions of ‘compatibility’ rather than significance. I included Heut et al.&nbsp;paper because it shows how to provide a more nuanced interpretation of a ‘non-significant’ RCT using straightforward Bayesian inference and moreover all statistical code to reproduce its findings is provided. This should get you thinking about how you will manage your inferences in your own research</p>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="why-20">Why:</h4>
<p>Meta-analysis of a systematic review has become the dominant method for summarizing epidemiologic evidence, but comes with a large set of challenges, particularly for observational studies. These two papers provide an overview of some of the challenges of how these contribute to evidence, and whether they are ultimately useful for informing causal inference about the effects of exposures.</p>

<p>This week we will be reading more about the (possible) tension between our duties as epidemiologic scientists to try and report evidence in a dispassionate way, and the sometimes pressing need for action to tackle pressing health problems when evidence is uncertain, or in contrast to our expectations.</p>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="why-21">Why:</h4>
<p>Thissession’s readings are focused more on how to grapple with and communicate uncertainty in epidemiologic findings, both to other scientists (e.g., in peer-reviewed papers) and to the public or to other stakeholders. The chapter by Savitz and Wellenius provides some high-level guidance and advice to epidemiologists about their duties to describe evidence in a dispassionate way, but also to make good faith efforts to distill findings in ways suitably tailored for different audiences. Some additional discussion of how to consider biases across different studies when synthesizing evidence is also included. The piece by Blastland et al.&nbsp;is more direct in providing advice to scientists on how to communicate about evidence, largely arguing that our duties are to be transparent in reporting, especially about uncertainty, rather than attempting to persuade or change opinions.</p>

<p>David Merritt Johns uses the recent example of a ‘novel’ finding in nutritional epidemiology as a basis for an essay about the role that extra-scientific judgements play in how we as scientists (and humans) interpret findings that may contrast with our expectations. How will you react if your study produces findings in opposition to what you may have hypothesized?</p>

<p>We’ve discussed multiple theoretical and methodological issues thus far, many of which stem from, and cannot be separated from, the fact that science is conducted by humans. This creates a kind of cultural inertia in science that has produced important advances, but also creates problems. Can we change the culture to improve the way epidemiology is working today? This last session asks you to consider this question.</p>

<h2 data-number="7.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="academic-offences"><span class="header-section-number">7.1</span> Academic offences</h2>
<p>The integrity of University academic life and of the degrees the University confers is dependent upon the honesty and soundness of the teacher- student learning relationship and, as well, that of the evaluation process. Conduct by any member of the University community that adversely affects this relationship or this process must, therefore, be considered a serious offence. McGill University values academic integrity. Therefore all students must understand the meaning and consequences of cheating, plagiarism and other academic offences under the Code of Student Conduct and Disciplinary Procedures (see http://www.mcgill.ca/integrity for more information).</p>
<p>L’université McGill attache une haute importance à l’honnêteté académique. Il incombe par conséquent à tous les étudiants de comprendre ce que l’on entend par tricherie, plagiat et autres infractions académiques, ainsi que les conséquences que peuvent avoir de telles actions, selon le Code de conduite de l’étudiant et des procédures disciplinaires (pour de plus amples renseignements, veuillez consulter le site http://www.mcgill.ca/integrity).</p>
