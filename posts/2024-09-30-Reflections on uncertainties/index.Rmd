## Background

I recently read an article entitled "One-Year Outcomes of Transseptal
Mitral Valvein- Valve in Intermediate Surgical Risk Patients"[@MVIV]
[paper](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCINTERVENTIONS.123.013782).
After examining 50 patients from 12 sites that underwent mitral
valve-in-valve from 2018 to 2021 the authors concluded

> "Mitral valve-in-valve with a balloon-expandable valve via transseptal
> approach in intermediate-risk patients was associated with improved
> symptoms and quality of life, adequate transcatheter valve
> performance, and no mortality or stroke at 1-year follow-up."

This prompted me to wonder how probable would it be to observe 0 deaths
in the 50 patients at 1 year if the annual transcather mitral valve
mortality was actually the same as their expected value with a surgical
redo, 4%. I also wondered how well my colleagues would estimate this
uncertainty (probability) and therefore created and circulated the
following short questionnaire.

## Quiz

A recent
[study](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCINTERVENTIONS.123.013782)
reported no mortality in 50 patients undergoing transcatheter mitral
valve-in-valve replacement (MVIV) for patients with bioprosthetic valve
failure. The STS mortality score for these patients undergoing a
standard redo operation is an estimated 4%.

::: {style="color: red"}
Q1. If mortality rates with transcatheter MVIV are assumed the same as
with a standard redo, what is the probability of observing 0 deaths as
these authors did?\
:::

1)  \<1%\
2)  1 - 4.9%\
3)  5 -9.9%\
4)  10 - 14.9%\
5)  \> 15%

::: {style="color: red"}
Q2. If mortality rates with transcatheter MVIV were actually 40% higher
those with a standard redo, what is the probability of observing 0
deaths as these authors did?\
:::

1)  \<1%\
2)  1 - 4.9%\
3)  5 -9.9%\
4)  10 - 14.9%\
5)  \> 15%

::: {style="color: red"}
Q3. Given the above information (and that there is probably not a lot of
other of good quality available evidence), what is your probability
(belief) that MVIV is as safe or safer than a standard redo operation in
this population?\
:::

1)  \< 25 %\
2)  25 - 50%\
3)  51 - 75%\
4)  76 - 95%\
5)  \> 95%

## Basic Probability Distributions

Answering these questions, requires making some assumptions about
possible models, in other words underlying probability distributions,
that could represent the data. Here are some of the more common
probability distributions and their utility according to the available
data.

![](images/slide1.png){width="75%" fig-align="center"}

### Normal distribution

Normal distributions are ubiquitous and generally reasonably well
understood. They are important in medicine, at least partly due to the
central limit theorem that states under some conditions, the average of
many samples (observations) of a random variable with finite mean and
variance is itself a random variable—whose distribution converges to a
normal distribution as the number of samples increases. Therefore,
physical quantities that are expected to be the sum of many independent
processes, such as measurement errors, often have distributions that are
nearly normal.\
<br> Mathematically the normal distribution is expressed as
$$f(x) =  \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi \sigma^2}} e^{-\frac{(x-\mu)^2}{2 \sigma^2}}$$

where\
${\mu}$ is the mean or expectation of the distribution (and also its
median and mode)

${\sigma^{2}}$ is the variance and

${\sigma }$ is the standard deviation of the distribution

Graphically this may be plotted as shown

```{r out.width="50%", fig.align='center'}
n_dis = tibble(dist = c(dist_normal(0, 1)))

n_dis %>%
  ggplot(aes(y = format(dist), xdist = dist)) +
  stat_halfeye(aes(fill = after_stat(abs(x) < 1.96))) +
  labs(ggtitle="Normal (0,1) distribution", subtitle="Blue = 95% area", caption = "thick horizontal black line represents +/- 1 sd (68%) \nthin horizontal black line represents +/- 2 sd (95%)") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("gray85", "skyblue")) + 
  scale_y_discrete(expand = c(0, 0, 0, 1)) +
  ylab("") +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(legend.position="none")

```

### Student's t distribution

The Student's t distribution is another continuous probability
distribution that generalizes the standard normal distribution,
remaining symmetric around zero and bell-shaped but with heavier tails.
The amount of probability mass in the tails is controlled by the
parameter ${\nu}$. For ${\nu = 1}$ the Student's t distribution becomes
the standard Cauchy distribution, which has very "fat" tails; whereas
for ${\nu = \infty}$ it becomes the standard normal distribution

```{r out.width="75%"}
n_t_dis = tibble(
  dist = c(dist_normal(0, 1), dist_student_t(3, 0, 1))
)

n_t_dis %>%
  ggplot(aes(y = format(dist), xdist = dist)) +
  stat_halfeye(aes(fill = after_stat(abs(x) < 1.96))) +
  labs(title="Normal and t distribution", subtitle = "t distribution with 3 degrees of freedon", caption = "thick horizontal black line represents +/- 1 sd (68%) \nthin horizontal black line represents +/- 2 sd (95%)") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("gray85", "skyblue")) + 
  xlim(-5,5) +
  scale_y_discrete(expand = c(0, 0, 0, 1)) +
  ylab("") +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(legend.position="none")
```

### Uniform distribution

The uniform distribution assumes that all continuous outcomes between
boundaries have an equal probability of occurring.\
Graphically,

```{r out.width="50%", fig.align='center'}
# Create a density plot using ggplot2
ggplot(data.frame(Values = runif(10000, min = 0, max = 1)), aes(x = Values)) +
  geom_density(fill = "blue", alpha = 0.5) +  
  labs(title = "Density Plot of Uniform Distribution (0,1)", x = "Values", y = "Density") +
  theme_minimal()  
  
```

### Binomial Distribution

However for this quiz, the data are not continuous but discrete with
counts and therefore the above distributions would be inappropriate
models (cf negative counts being impossible). A binomial distribution is
a discrete probability distribution that describes the number of
successes in a fixed number of **independent Bernoulli trials, where
each trial has the same probability of success, denoted by *p***. The
distribution is characterized by two parameters: *n* the number of
trials, and *p*, the probability of success in each trial.

Mathematically, this can be expressed as\
$$P(X = k) = {n \choose x} * p^k * (1 - p)^{n-k}$$ • *P(X=k)* is the
probability of having k successes in n trials

• (nCk) is the binomial coefficient, also known as "n choose k", which
represents the number of ways to choose k successes from n trials

• *p* is the probability of success in each trial

• *1-p* is the probability of failure in each trial

• *n* is the total number of trials

• *k* is the number of successes

Binomial distributions are commonly used to model situations such as
coin flips, where there are two possible outcomes (success or failure)
and each trial is independent of the others. They have obviously
applications in various fields, including medicine.

### Poisson Distribution

The Poisson distribution is a discrete probability distribution that
represents the number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time or
space, given that these events occur with a constant rate and
independently of the time since the last event. It is named after the
French mathematician Siméon Denis Poisson.

Mathematically this can be expressed as\

$$P(X = k) = \frac{\lambda^k * e^{-\lambda}}{k!}$$ • *P(X=k)* is the
probability of observing k events in a given period of time

• $\lambda$ is the **expectation** of the events over the same period of
time

For a Poisson random variable, the **variance = mean = E(Y) =**
\$\lambda <br> The Poisson distribution is a special case of the
binomial, with trials *n* -\> $\infty$ and *p* (any trial success) -\>
0\
If *p* is small, binomial P(*k* successes) $\approx$ poisson P(*k* with
$\lambda$ = *np*)\
The Poisson distribution is perhaps better appreciated by plotting the
above equation

```{r out.width="60%"}
# Build Poisson distributions
options(digits = 3)
p_dat <- map_df(1:4, ~ tibble(
  l = paste(.),
  x = 0:10,
  y = dpois(0:10, .)
))
# Use ggplot2 to plot
ggplot(p_dat, aes(x, y, color = factor(l, levels = 1:5))) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point(data = p_dat, aes(x, y, color = factor(l, levels = 1:5))) +
  labs(color = "Lambda:") +
  ggtitle("Poisson distribution for varying rates (Lambda)") +
  scale_x_continuous("no. of events",breaks=seq(0,10, 1)) +
  ylab("probability") +
  theme_minimal()
```

## Quiz Answers

To appreciate the uncertainty associated with observing 0 deaths in 50
patients if the expected rate was 4%, one can use either a Poisson
distribution (counts) or a binomial distribution (independent Bernouilli
trials) where each of the 50 subjects is considered as alive or dead
with a probability of 4%. These calculations can be done with the above
equations or more easily with any software that includes Poisson or
Binomial distributions.

[Q1. If mortality rates with transcatheter MVIV are assumed the same as
with a standard redo, what is the probability of observing 0 deaths
asthese authors did?]{style="color:red"}

```{r}
options(digits=1)
# calculate the probability of 0 to 6 deaths among 50 patients with an expected rate of 4%
# binomial distribution
db <- 100*dbinom(c(0:8),50, .04) # expected 4% probability of death

# Poisson distribution
dp <- 100*dpois(c(0:8),2) # number of expected deaths among the 50 subjects over 1 year
# cat("Assuming a binomial distribution with an event (death) 
# probability of 4%, the probability for 0,1,2,3,4,5,6 events is  ", # db[1],"%,", db[2],"%,", db[3],"%,", db[4],"%,", db[5],"%,", # db[6],"%, respectively")
#cat("\nAssuming a Poisson distribution with an event (death) rate of # 2 (2 deaths / 50 individual in 1 year, 4% expected mortality), the # probability for 0,1,2,3,4,5,6 events is ", dp[1],"%,", dp[2],"%,", # dp[3],"%,", dp[4],"%,", dp[5],"%,", dp[6],"%, respectively")

```

Assuming a binomial distribution with an event (death) probability of
4%, the probability for 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 events is
`r round(db[1],1)`%, `r round(db[2],1)`%, `r round(db[3],1)`%,
`r round(db[4],1)`%, `r round(db[5],1)`%, `r round(db[6],1)`%,
respectively.\
<br> Assuming a Poisson distribution with an event (death) rate of 2 (#
deaths in 50 individual in 1 year with 4% expected mortality), the
probability for 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 events is `r round(dp[1],1)`%,
`r round(dp[2],1)`%, `r round(dp[3],1)`%, `r round(dp[4],1)`%,
`r round(dp[5],1)`%, `r round(dp[6],1)`%, respectively.

This data can also be visualized as shown here

```{r out.width="50%"}
# Build Poisson distributions
options(digits = 3)
p_dat <- map_df(2, ~ tibble(
  l = paste(.),
  x = 0:10,
  y = dpois(0:10, .)
))
# Use ggplot2 to plot
ggplot(p_dat, aes(x, y, color = factor(l, levels = 1:5))) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point(data = p_dat, aes(x, y, color = factor(l, levels = 1:5))) +
  labs(color = "Lambda:") +
  ggtitle("Poisson distribution for death \nrate of 2 / 50 subjects per year") +
  scale_x_continuous("no. of events",breaks=seq(0,10, 1)) +
  ylab("probability") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position="none")
```

The similarity between the Poisson and Binomial distributions is shown
graphically below

```{r out.width="60%"}
options(digits=2)
df <- data.frame(y=round(rbinom(50000,50,.04)))

g = ggplot(df, aes(x=y)) 
# g + geom_histogram(binwidth=1, fill="grey60", color="red") # counts
# g + geom_histogram(aes(y=after_stat(density)), binwidth=1, fill="grey60", color="red") # density

g + geom_histogram(aes(y=after_stat(density)), binwidth=1, # density
                   fill="grey60", color="red") +
  geom_density(adjust=5, color="red", size=1.1) +
  xlab("counts") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 10, by = 1)) +
  ggtitle("Histogram (and kernal density) of count from a 
  \nBinomial (50, 0.04) probability distribution")

# same code for Poisson
# df1 <- data.frame(y=round(rpois(50000,2)))

```

**Therefore the answer to Q1 is 10 - 14.9%**

::: {style="color: red"}
Q2. If mortality rates with transcatheter MVIV were actually 40% higher
those with a standard redo, what is the probability of observing 0
deaths as these authors did?
:::

In other words what is the probability of observing 0 deaths if the
expected rate was 5.6% (4\*1.4).

```{r}

options(digits=1)
# calculate the probability of 0 to 6 deaths among 50 patients with an expected rate of 4%
# binomial distribution
db1 <- 100*dbinom(c(0:8),50, .056) # expected 4% probability of death

# Poisson distribution
dp1 <- 100*dpois(c(0:8),2.8) # number of expected deaths among the 50 subjects over 1 year

```

Assuming a binomial distribution with an event (death) probability of
5.6%, the probability for 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 events is
`r round(db1[1],1)`%, `r round(db1[2],1)`%, `r round(db1[3],1)`%,
`r round(db1[4],1)`%, `r round(db1[5],1)`%, `r round(db1[6],1)`%,
respectively.\
<br> Assuming a Poisson distribution with an event (death) rate of 2.8
(# deaths in 50 individual in 1 year with 5.6% expected mortality), the
probability for 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 events is `r round(dp1[1],1)`%,
`r round(dp1[2],1)`%, `r round(dp1[3],1)`%, `r round(dp1[4],1)`%,
`r round(dp1[5],1)`%, `r round(dp1[6],1)`%, respectively.

This may be easier to appreciate visually

```{r out.width="50%"}
p_dat <- map_df(c(2,2.8), ~ tibble(
  l = paste(.),
  x = 0:10,
  y = dpois(0:10, .)
))
# Use ggplot2 to plot
ggplot(p_dat, aes(x, y, color = factor(l, levels = c(2,2.8)))) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point(data = p_dat, aes(x, y, color = factor(l, levels = c(2,2.8)))) +
  labs(color = "Rates") +
  ggtitle("Poisson distribution for varying rates") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(1:10), limits = c(0, 10)) +
  theme_minimal()
```

Clearly, if the expected death rate is higher the curves shift left
meaning the probability of observing 0 deaths will fall with increasing
mortality rates, so\
**The answer to Q2 is 5 - 9.9%**

::: {style="color: red"}
Q3. Given the above information (and that there is probably not a lot of
other of good quality available evidence), what is your probability
(belief) that MVIV is as safe or safer than a standard redo operation in
this population?
:::

Iideally one would like to know the outcome with both interventions in
the same patient but such counterfactuals unfortunately don't exist. As
an alternative we perform randomized trials, where we hope that subjects
in the two treatment arms are exchangeable. In this case, we lack a
proper comparative arm but can assume that if the STS model is accurate
and that the MVIV patients would have had a 4% mortality if instead of
MVIV they had had a surgical redo. Therefore our data are the 50
observed MVIV results and 50 results under a redo operation with a 4%
mortality rate.

```{r eval=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, cache=TRUE}
# create data frame
dat1 <- tibble(Trial = c("study", "study"), Tx = c("redo", "MVIV"),
               fail = c(2, 0),
               success = c(48,50)) %>% 
  mutate(total = fail + success,
         prop_success = success / total) 

fit4 <- brm(success | trials(total) ~ Tx, data = dat1, iter = 10000,
            family = binomial(link="identity"), refresh=0,
            control = list(adapt_delta = .999),
            backend = "cmdstanr", seed = 123,
            file = "fit4.RDS") #aggregate data

```

```{r}
fit4 <- readRDS("fit4.RDS")
summary(fit4)
```

As expected the mean mortality difference (MVIV - redo) is - 4% with 95%
credible intervals -13% -to 3% This probability density for this
mortality difference is shown graphically below

```{r out.width="50%"}
draws <- as_draws_df(fit4)
p_gt_0 <- sum(draws$b_Txredo >0) / 20000
draws %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = b_Txredo, fill = stat(x > 0))) +
  stat_halfeye(point_interval = mean_qi, .width = .95) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("gray85", "skyblue")) +
  scale_y_continuous(NULL, breaks = NULL) +
  xlab("Mortality differece (Redo - MVIV)") +
  labs(title = "Mortality difference (surgical redo - catheter MVIV)",
       subtitle = "Blue area = probability increased mortality with MVIV (23.5%)") +
  theme_ggdist() +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

This figure shows that there is a 11.7% probability that MVIV patients
in this study would have a worse outcome with a surgical redo, provided
their underlying mortality has been well predicted with the STS model.
Alternatively, the probability that MVIV is as safe or safer than a redo
is 88.3%.\
**Therefore the answer to Q3 is 76-95%**

## Discussion

For Q1, only 3 people (16%) correctly estimated that there was a
10-14.9% probability of observing 0 deaths in 50 patients, if the true
underlying mortality rate was 4%. Of the 16 respondents who incorrectly
estimated the probability, most (13 of 16) underestimated the
probability of observing 0 deaths.\
<br> For Q2, most respondents (13/19, 68%) correctly reasoned that if
the true underlying mortality increased, it would be more unlikely to
observe 0 deaths. However 6 individuals didn't appreciate this and
incorrectly predicted no change or an increase in the probability of
observing 0 deaths if the true underlying rate was higher.\
<br> For Q3, there are many assumptions required and estimates are
likely fairly unreliable. Nevertheless, the question asked to ignore the
potential biases and to consider only the data in this one study. Only 2
(10.5%) of individuals correctly estimated the probability of MVIV being
as safe or safer than a redo being in the 76-95% interval. 12 of 19
(63%) of respondents estimated this probability at being under 50%.\
<br>\
Drawing meaningful conclusions is obviously limited by the limited
number of respondents, especially among the fellows. It is unknown if
respondents have better, worse or same quantitative skills as the
non-respondents. Notwithstanding this limitation, it would appear from
the wide range of responses and the limited number of "correct" answers
that additional quantitative training may be helpful.
